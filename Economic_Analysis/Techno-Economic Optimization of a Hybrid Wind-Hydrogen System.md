Techno-Economic Optimization of a Hybrid Wind-Hydrogen System📖 OverviewThis repository contains the code, data analysis, and financial modeling for the techno-economic optimization of a hybrid wind-hydrogen system. Based on a case study of the Bürgerwindpark Reußenköge in Northern Germany, this project provides a data-driven solution to two of the most pressing challenges in the renewable energy sector:Grid Congestion (Curtailment): The physical inability of the grid to transport all generated wind power, leading to Einspeisemanagement (forced shutdowns).Price Cannibalization: The economic deflation of wind energy value, where high regional wind generation drives Day-Ahead market prices to zero or negative values.By integrating a 50 MW Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer with a 170 MW wind farm, this project demonstrates how sector-coupling can serve as a "congestion valve" and a financial hedge.⚙️ System ArchitectureWind Asset: 170 MW total capacity, modeled using the Vestas V112-3.45 MW turbine power curve to accurately capture partial-load aerodynamics.Hydrogen Asset: 50 MW PEM electrolyzer, modeled after the Siemens Silyzer 300, chosen for its rapid load ramping capabilities (10% to 100% in under one minute).Simulation Resolution: Hourly "digital twin" simulation spanning the calendar year 2024 (8,760 hours).📊 Data SourcesThe simulation relies on high-fidelity, real-world data:Meteorological Data: Wind speed vectors from the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis dataset, evaluated at a 100m hub height.Market Data: 2024 Day-Ahead spot prices for the Germany-Luxembourg (DE-LU) bidding zone via the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform.Grid Constraints: "Current-Induced Load Decrease" redispatch logs from TenneT TSO, used to build a localized curtailment profile.🧠 Smart Dispatch AlgorithmThe core of this project is a Python-based dispatch algorithm that optimizes the system's operation using a hierarchical decision tree:Grid Compliance: If the grid is congested, mandated curtailed power is immediately diverted to the electrolyzer (marginal cost of zero).Price Arbitrage: The algorithm calculates a dynamic breakeven threshold (approx. €95.79/MWh) based on a target hydrogen sale price of €5.00/kg and a system efficiency of 52.2 kWh/kg.IF Spot Price < €95.79 $\rightarrow$ Produce Hydrogen.IF Spot Price > €95.79 $\rightarrow$ Sell Electricity to Grid.📈 Key ResultsThe integration of the electrolyzer yields a highly competitive and bankable financial profile:Grid Service: Successfully recovered 35.7 GWh of energy that would have been lost to grid curtailment (approx. 4.88% of total potential).Revenue Uplift: Generated an additional €10.96 Million compared to a standalone wind farm baseline.Financial Viability: * Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH): €4.90/kg.Net Present Value (NPV): €7.04 Million.Internal Rate of Return (IRR): 8.0%, successfully clearing the standard 7% WACC hurdle.
